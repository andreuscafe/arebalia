# Arebalia
Arebalia, the game

Game based on (and made with) [Love](https://love2d.org/), a basic yet powerful Lua game engine.

It's not ready to be played but, if you insist on trying, you'll need to download [Love](https://love2d.org/) and execute this entire folder with it.

(Note that I really meant the folder, not the `main.lua` file)

So, that's it. Nothing to see here yet.
